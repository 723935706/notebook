What Is Meta Data?

Metadata is information that describes data assets, providing context and meaning to help users understand the data. It includes a wide range of information, such as data types, data formats, data sources, and data relationships. It can be classified into different types:

Descriptive metadata -  Metadata that describes the content and characteristics of a data asset, including its title, creator, date of creation, and subject matter. It provides a summary of the data asset and helps users understand its purpose and relevance.

Structural metadata -  Data that establishes the organization and structure of a data asset, including its file format, schema, and relationships with other data assets. It helps users understand the underlying structure of the data and how it relates to other data assets.

Administrative metadata -  Metadata that provides information about the management and use of a data asset, including its ownership, access rights, retention policies, and data quality measures. It helps users understand how the data asset should be managed, stored, and used.

Metadata is critical for effective data management, as it enables users to easily find, access, and use data assets. It also helps organizations ensure data quality and compliance by providing a framework for managing data lineage, data security, and data governance.
